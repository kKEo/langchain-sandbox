Exercise 2: Build a Calculator Agent with Custom Math Tools

TASK:
Create an agent with custom math tools that can perform various
mathematical operations. Include tools for:
- Basic arithmetic
- Power/exponentiation
- Square root

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create custom tools for each math operation
2. Initialize an agent with all tools
3. Test with complex mathematical queries
4. Ensure the agent can chain multiple operations

HINT: Create Tool objects with clear descriptions
