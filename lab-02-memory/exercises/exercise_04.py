Exercise 4: Customer Support Assistant with Context Retention

TASK:
Build a customer support assistant that uses ConversationSummaryBufferMemory
to handle long support conversations. It should:
1. Remember customer details and issues
2. Summarize old parts of the conversation
3. Keep recent messages in full detail
4. Provide context-aware responses

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use ConversationSummaryBufferMemory with appropriate max_token_limit
2. Create a conversation chain with a system message for customer support
3. Simulate a support conversation with:
   - Customer introduction and issue description
   - Multiple back-and-forth exchanges
   - Resolution steps
4. Verify the assistant remembers key information throughout

HINT: Use ChatPromptTemplate with system message for better control
