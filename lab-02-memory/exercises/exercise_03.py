Exercise 3: Create Summary Memory System

TASK:
Build a chatbot that uses ConversationSummaryMemory to summarize
old conversations while maintaining context. This is ideal for
very long conversations.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use ConversationSummaryMemory with an LLM
2. Create a conversation chain
3. Simulate a conversation with multiple topics
4. Display the memory summary to see how old messages are summarized
5. Verify the chatbot can still reference summarized information

HINT: ConversationSummaryMemory needs an LLM for summarization
